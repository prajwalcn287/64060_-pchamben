### KNN Classifier

Objective:

Universal bank is a young bank growing rapidly in terms of overall customer acquisition. The
majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of relationship
with the bank. The customer base of asset customers (borrowers) is quite small, and the bank is
interested in expanding this base rapidly in more loan business. In particular, it wants to explore
ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers.

A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate
of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise smarter
campaigns with better target marketing. The goal is to use k-NN to predict whether a new
customer will accept a loan offer. This will serve as the basis for the design of a new campaign.

The file UniversalBank.csv contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer
demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customerâ€™s relationship with the bank
(mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan
campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the
personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.
